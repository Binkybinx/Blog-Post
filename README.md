This project helped me understand the following CSS concepts:

- View Height and View Width viewport units for responsive design.
- Use Flexbox to center my hero class.
- Gain a deeper understanding of CSS specificity and cascade.
- Learned how styles are applied based on specificity.
- Improved debugging skills for styling conflicts.
